qpth warning: Returning an inaccurate and potentially incorrect solution.

Some residual is large.
Your problem may be infeasible or difficult.

You can try using the CVXPY solver to see if your problem is feasible
and you can use the verbose option to check the convergence status of
our solver while increasing the number of iterations.
